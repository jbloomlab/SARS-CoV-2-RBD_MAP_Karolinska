# Interactive structural visualizations of escape mutation maps

Below are links to interactive visualizations of the effects of single mutations to the SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) on recognition by three affinity-matured IGHV3-53 neutralizing antibodies. 
These visualizations are built using [dms-view](https://dms-view.github.io/docs/).
These experiments are described in **this pre-print**, and raw data are available [here](https://github.com/jbloomlab/SARS-CoV-2-RBD_MAP_Karolinska/blob/main/results/supp_data/karolinska_raw_data.csv).

Sites of escape are shown for each antibody, and are mapped to the ACE2-bound RBD structure ([PDB 6M0J](https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6M0J).

`dms-view` renderings for each antibody's escape mapped to the ACE2-bound RBD structure:
